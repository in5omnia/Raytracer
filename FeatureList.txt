** Basic raytracer features (all implemented and demonstrated) **

1 - Image writing (PPM Format)
Implemented: Yes
Demonstrated: Yes
Successfully writes rendered images in PPM format, verified with binary and phong render modes.

2 - Virtual Pin-hole Camera (5)
Implemented: Yes
Demonstrated: Yes
Virtual pinhole camera correctly maps 3D world coordinates to 2D image space. Verified in test scenes.

3 - Intersection tests (Sphere, Triangle, Cylinder)
Implemented: Yes
Demonstrated: Yes
Ray-geometry intersection tests work for spheres, triangles, and cylinders. Verified by rendering scenes with these primitives.

4 - Binary Image Writing (Intersection/No Intersection)
Implemented: Yes
Demonstrated: Yes
Binary mode renders red for intersections and black for no hits. Output matches example binary images.

5 - Blinn-Phong shading (5)
Implemented: Yes
Demonstrated: Yes
Implemented Blinn-Phong shading for diffuse and specular lighting. Verified by rendering phong mode scenes.

6 - Shadows
Implemented: Yes
Demonstrated: Yes
Shadows cast by objects are correctly rendered. Verified in phong render mode.

7 - Tone Mapping (Linear)
Implemented: Yes
Demonstrated: Yes
Linear tone mapping applied to prevent overexposure. Verified by rendering high-intensity light scenes.

8 - Reflection
Implemented: Yes
Demonstrated: Yes
Reflections calculated for reflective surfaces. Verified in mirror scene outputs.

9 - Refraction
Implemented: Yes
Demonstrated: Yes
Refractions calculated for transparent materials with varying indices of refraction. Verified in rendered images.

** Intermediate raytracer features (all implemented and demonstrated) **

10 - Textures (Sphere, Triangle, Cylinder)
Implemented: Yes
Demonstrated: Yes
Textures applied using UV mapping. Verified by rendering textured primitives.

11 - Bounding Volume Hierarchy (Acceleration Structure)
Implemented: Yes
Demonstrated: Yes
BVH implemented and validated through improved rendering efficiency and printed tree structure.
